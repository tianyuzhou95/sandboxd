# CI Checks

Before completing a change, run the checks relevant to it:

```sh
make check-fmt
make vet
make test
```

For protobuf changes, also run:

```sh
make check-protos
```

For changes under `bpf/bpfnat` or `pkg/networkmanager/bpfnat`, also run:

```sh
make check-bpf
make bpfnat-test
```

`make bpfnat-test` runs privileged dataplane, map, garbage-collection,
restart, and lifecycle tests in an isolated container network namespace and
bpffs mount. The default GitHub CI workflow runs it in the network dataplane
job.

When changing bpfnat behavior, extend the regular unit tests for pure parsing
and policy logic and add or update the tagged integration tests for
kernel-visible behavior and relevant boundary cases.

# Runtime Artifact Pins

`third_party/runtime-versions.env` is the single source of truth for runtime
artifacts used by sandboxd E2E and packaged by AKernel. Keep each release,
download URL, and checksum synchronized. Do not duplicate runtime versions in
CI workflow environment variables or Dockerfiles.

The AKernel gVisor release is a temporary compatibility build based on an
upstream release tag. It currently carries the direct-TAP `readv` seccomp fix
and the KVM address-width fix for hosts without LA57. When updating gVisor,
first check whether upstream already includes both fixes and remove downstream
patches that are no longer required.

Build a gVisor candidate through the gated workflow in
`akernel-dev/gvisor`, then test that exact candidate with the complete
sandboxd runtime suite and the AKernel standalone E2E. Promote the candidate
without rebuilding it. Only after promotion should this repository pin the
published release URL and its verified SHA-512 digest.

The AKernel Firecracker release is a checksum-pinned runtime bundle from
`akernel-dev/firecracker`. It reuses the official VMM binary and packages the
tested guest kernel, resolved configuration, licenses, checksums, and
provenance. Build and test an expiring candidate with sandboxd and AKernel,
then promote those exact bytes without rebuilding them. Only after promotion
should this repository update the bundle release, URL, and SHA-256 pin. The
sandboxd-built `firecracker-agent` initrd deliberately remains outside that
bundle so its guest protocol always matches the consuming sandboxd revision.

Run the complete runtime compatibility suite on a nested-KVM host with:

```sh
make e2e-runtime-suite
```

The suite builds the project binaries once, assembles targeted runtime images,
and tests runsc with systrap, runsc with KVM, Kata, Firecracker, and runc. CI
passes those binaries to five independent matrix jobs. Keep the gVisor TAP
contract, network ACL cases, and AKernel's shared manifest consumer in sync
when changing this path.

# Checkpoint and Restore Contract

When changing the checkpoint/restore API, runtime support, artifact ownership,
compatibility requirements, or failure semantics, update
`doc/checkpoint-restore.md` in the same change so the public design contract
stays synchronized with the implementation.

# Firecracker Storage Contract

The Firecracker adapter accepts only local or image-provider-backed regular
EROFS files for its root filesystem and filesystem image mounts. Do not add
OCI or Nydus directory conversion, runtime-specific image caching, or shared
artifact reference counting to sandboxd or its image manager. Produce EROFS
before sandbox creation and let the existing image provider own distribution,
lazy loading, and deduplication.

Per-sandbox Firecracker storage is limited to the private ext4 writable layer
and runtime state. Bounded read-only regular-file injection is a separate
startup-metadata mechanism used for files such as `resolv.conf`; it must not
grow into general directory or writable host sharing.
