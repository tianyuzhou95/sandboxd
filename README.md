# sandboxd

**sandboxd** is the Linux sandbox lifecycle service used by [AKernel](https://github.com/akernel-dev/akernel). It exposes a small gRPC API, manages sandbox resources, and runs sandboxes with [gVisor](https://github.com/google/gvisor), [Kata Containers](https://github.com/kata-containers/kata-containers), [Firecracker](https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firecracker), or the optional host-kernel [runc](https://github.com/opencontainers/runc) adapter.

## Responsibilities

- Start, wait for, inspect, measure, and delete sandboxes.
- Prepare local, OCI, Nydus, and S3-backed rootfs and mounts.
- Allocate cgroups and pooled TAP or ephemeral veth endpoints, and configure iptables or eBPF for NAT.
- Discover, validate, and lease scheduler-selected accelerator devices.

## Architecture

```

## API / CLI

The public protobuf contract is [api/runtime/v1/sandbox-api.proto](api/runtime/v1/sandbox-api.proto).
Runtime isolation, host requirements, and lifecycle differences are summarized
in [doc/runtime.md](doc/runtime.md).

The `sbox` binary is an administrative CLI for managing sandboxes.

### NVIDIA GPU sandboxes

GPU support is experimental and currently uses gVisor runsc with nvproxy. The
scheduler passes concrete node-local device IDs through
`StartRequest.xpu_allocations`; sandboxd resolves them to NVIDIA UUIDs and
maintains a local exclusive lease:

```bash
sbox start \
  --rootfs /path/to/directory-rootfs \
  --xpu-allocation gpu:0,2 \
  /bin/sleep 300
```

When `[plugin.node_resource]` is enabled, `/resource` includes the stable XPU
inventory:

```json
{"cpu":32,"mem":68719476736,"xpu":[{"type":"gpu","product_model":"l20","device_ids":[0,1]}]}
```

Kubernetes remains the default CPU and memory provider. A standalone process
can report the effective limits of its own cgroup without Kubernetes access:

```toml
[plugin.node_resource]
provider = "cgroup"
sock_path = "/run/sandboxd/resource.sock"
```

The cgroup provider is read-only and works with both cgroup v1 and v2. It does
not enable controllers or create child cgroups, including when experimental
cgroup-disabled execution is selected.

See [test/e2e/README.md](test/e2e/README.md#gpu-debug-image) for the validated
GPU debug image and manual CUDA test.

## Network backends

Sandboxd supports two NAT backends:

- `iptables` is the default backend.
- `bpfnat` is an experimental embedded TC eBPF backend for Linux 5.10 or
  newer.

Select the backend with `plugin.network.nat_backend`. See the
[bpfnat implementation notes](bpf/bpfnat/README.md) for its host prerequisites
and build workflow.

An optional per-sandbox ACL uses native netfilter and ipset with the `iptables`
backend and TC eBPF with the `bpfnat` backend. Both support prioritized
stateful IPv4 CIDR, domain, protocol, and port rules, fragments, and managed
DNS policies. See
[the network ACL guide](doc/network-acl.md) for its API, host requirements,
limitations, and recovery behavior.

## Build and test

```bash
make
make test
make vet
make networkacl-test
make bpfnat-test
```

`networkacl-test` runs one backend-neutral conformance suite against native
iptables and TC eBPF enforcement in isolated network namespaces. It covers
allow and deny precedence, exact and wildcard peers, peer and sandbox ports,
stateful TCP, UDP, ICMP and related errors, IPv4 fragments, DNS redirection,
policy replacement, restart recovery, and policy removal. `bpfnat-test` adds
backend-specific NAT, map lifecycle, and garbage-collection coverage.

The privileged E2E suite covers runsc, runc, Kata Containers, and
Firecracker. Runsc and runc use the default image; the two VM runtimes are
selected separately with their KVM artifacts:

```bash
RUNSC_BINARY=/usr/local/bin/runsc \
RUNC_BINARY=/usr/local/bin/runc \
make e2e

E2E_RUNTIME=firecracker \
FIRECRACKER_BINARY=/usr/local/bin/firecracker \
FIRECRACKER_KERNEL=/opt/firecracker/vmlinux \
FIRECRACKER_INITRD=/opt/firecracker/initrd.img \
make e2e
```

See [test/e2e/README.md](test/e2e/README.md) for all runtime commands and
coverage. AKernel integration is validated through its all-in-one node image
and standalone deployment.

## Protobuf development

Protobuf generation uses a pinned Docker image defined by the Makefile and `tools/protobuf.Dockerfile`, independent of host-installed protobuf tools:

```bash
make protos
make check-protos
```

Commit the generated Go bindings with the corresponding protobuf change.

## Known limitations

- Kata Containers and Firecracker require a usable `/dev/kvm`; nodes without
  KVM continue to support gVisor. Firecracker additionally requires a compatible
  guest kernel/initrd, an EROFS root image, and the ext4 image tool. Nodes that
  enable OCI/Nydus rootfs materialization also require `mkfs.erofs`.
- NVIDIA GPU sandboxes require runsc, a directory/lisafs-backed rootfs,
  `nvidia-container-cli`, accessible NVIDIA devices and userspace driver
  libraries, and a host driver supported by the pinned runsc nvproxy. Kata,
  Firecracker, runc, MIG, fractional GPUs, and regular-file/EROFS rootfs are
  not supported.
- sandboxd detects the local cgroup mode at startup. Legacy and hybrid hosts use cgroup v1; unified hosts use cgroup v2. The gRPC API and resource-cache behavior are identical in both modes.
- `[plugin.resource].disable_cgroup = true` enables an experimental/debug
  compatibility mode for environments where sandboxd cannot write the
  delegated hierarchy. sandboxd, distill-fs, and runsc then perform no cgroup
  writes; runsc sandboxes inherit the sandboxd process cgroup. Per-sandbox
  CPU, memory, and pids requests are accepted but not enforced, per-sandbox
  Stats returns `FailedPrecondition`, and non-runsc runtimes are not
  advertised. Do not use this mode when per-sandbox resource isolation is
  required.
- To minimize sandbox startup latency, sandboxd caches and reuses physical cgroups across sandbox leases. Cumulative CPU accounting and peak-memory statistics therefore cover the physical cgroup lifetime, and reclaimable charges such as page cache may remain until kernel pressure reclaims them; CPU utilization calculated from sampling deltas and configured resource limits remain correct for the active sandbox.
- The direct OCI registry client currently skips TLS certificate verification and should only be used with trusted registries.
